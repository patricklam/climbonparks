<div class="startHidden" id="letterText">Dear Minister Piccini,

I am contacting you in the wake of recent climbing closures at Devil’s Glen Provincial Park.
Access and the ability to rock climb in our provincial parks is important to me and my
community.

I am asking for your support in allowing rock climbing within our provincial parks, and thereby
realizing the benefits that rock climbing can bring to our province.
● Rock climbing is a rapidly growing sport, with thousands of Ontarians participating
● Rock climbing boosts tourism, supports local economies, and is a growing industry in our province
● Rock climbing and ecological interests are aligned, and proper management plans cultivate conservation
● Rock climbing is a safe and fun part of a healthy lifestyle, benefiting both physical and mental health

Rock climbing has occurred at areas like Devil’s Glen and Lion’s Head for over 50 years, yet climbing management plans are not in place. As a result, there is ineffective and inconsistent management of climbing, resulting in lost opportunities for tourism, recreation, stakeholder engagement, and collaborative conservation.

My ask is that Section 11 of Ontario Regulation 347/07: Provincial Parks: General Provisions be changed to allow rock climbing and to mandate that parks formulate management plans to allow climbing.

The Ontario Alliance of Climbers (OAC) is a volunteer non-profit organization that works in collaboration with stakeholders to steward access to outdoor rock climbing.

I would like the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks to work in collaboration with the OAC to develop provincial climbing management plans and open Ontario Parks to rock climbing.

By doing this you will allow Ontarians and visitors to recreationally rock climb in our provincial parks, contribute to Ontario’s economy, and be partners in ecological conservation.

Sincerely,
[Name]
[City/Town]
